VISION FOR BOTH

Front
-Main page has search bar and recently added
-All pages will have the search bar except for adding the songs
-Adding songs needs a single login from a single login page
-Selecting genre-dropdown with "add new"?
-Are genres even needed?
-Searching artist v song-radio?  Dropdown?  What's most responsive?
-Black and white just like the rest of the website?

Back
-Variety of API calls
-Requests as already defined
-Heroku Free tier
-Get Juan on board with some light troubleshooting?
